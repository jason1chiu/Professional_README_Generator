  ## Description
  My motivation to create a README Generator is to encourage developers to always include professioanl README.md files for their projects so that users understand what their projects do. I built this project because I want to let developers like myself to easily generate README.md files describing projects such as this one. It solves the problem to create a detailed README.md file that should include the title, description, installation instructions, usage, credits and license for a project by asking a series of questions that developers should ask themselves when their project is ready to share. I learned how to use the command line in the terminal to ask questions and find responses to generate a descriptive README.md file using JavaScript, node.js, and npm.

  ## Table of Contents:

  1. [Installation](#installation)
  2. [Usage](#usage)
  3. [Collaborating](#collaborating)
  4. [Test](#test)
  5. [Questions](#questions)

  ## Installation
  <br>1. Go to this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jason1chiu/proREADMEgenerator/tree/main)<br>2. Git clone this repo using HTTPS or SSH into a folder of your choice.

  ## Usage
  This README.md file is an example itself where I used my README Generator. After installation, run the code in the terminal. You will be asked 15 questions. After answering each question, press ENTER. When you reach the last question, your command line should show "README.md Successfully Created!". In the folder that you clone this repository, a README.md file will appear.

  ## Features
  For the Description section and the Contributing section, I followed the Professional README Guide to ask four separate questions to write up a good description, and divide the contributors into three different subsections, respectively. Finally, I included this Features section and How to Contribute section based on the Professional README Guide, which is a little more than what I was asked for to do.
