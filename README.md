## Description
The driving force behind my creation of a README Generator is to promote the consistent use of professional README.md files among developers, thereby enabling users to gain a clear understanding of the functionality and purpose of their projects. The impetus for constructing this project is to provide developers, including myself, with a simple means of generating descriptive README.md for projects akin to this one. By prompting developers with a series of questions to consider when preparing their project for sharing, it resolves the challenge of crafting a comprehensive README.md thatt incorporates crucial elements such as the title, description, installation instructions, usage guidelines, credits, and licensing information. Through the use of JavaScript, node.js, and npm, I acquired the knowledge to utilize the command line interface in the terminal to ask pertinent questions and retrieve corresponding answers, culminating in the generation of a descriptive README.md.

## Installation
<br>1. Go to this [Github Repo](http://github.com/jason1chiu/Professional_README_Generator).<br>2. Git clone this repo using HTTPS or SSH into a folder of your choice.<br>3. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).<br>4. Install [npm inquirer v8.2.4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).

## Usage
Exemplifying the functionality of my README Generator, this very README.md was created using the tool. To utilize the generator, simplity follow the steps for installation, and execute the code in the terminal beginning with "node index". The program will subsequently prompt you with 15 inquiries; after responding to each prompt and pressing ENTER, you will reach the final question, upon which the command line will confirm the successful creation of the README.md. You can then find the newly generated file in the same folder where you cloned this respository. A video in the [Test](#test) section shows a demonstration on how to use the README Generator.

## Features
To construct the Description and Credits sections of the README, I adhere to the guidelines outlined in the Professional README Guide, which entailed posing four distinct inquiries to faciliate the creation of a well-crafted project summary and dividing the credits into three separate subsections. In addition, I went beyond the original scope of the project by incorporating the Features and Contribute sections, drawing inspiration from the aforementioned Professional README Guide.
