# README Generator
  
  ## Description
  My motivation to create a README Generator is to encourage developers to always include professioanl README.md files for their projects so that users understand what their projects do. I built this project because I want to let developers like myself to easily generate README.md files describing projects such as this one. It solves the problem to create a detailed README.md file that should include the title, description, installation instructions, usage, credits and license for a project by asking a series of questions that developers should ask themselves when their project is ready to share. I learned how to use the command line in the termin to ask a few questions to generate a descriptive README.md file using JavaScript, node.js, and npm.
